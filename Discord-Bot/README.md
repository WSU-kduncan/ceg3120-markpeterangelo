Part 3:

- Setup
* how to get an API token
* where to put it to work with the code
* dependencies (what packages need to be installed to run the code)
- Usage
* with your changes to the code in place, describe
* what commands you can type in your Discord server
* what response this will provide (from your bot)
- Research
* you may have realized that it is lame that it only runs when you run the program.
* In the real world, things are "always on", not waiting for Bob to turn his PC on and make sure the program is running.
Research some possible solutions that would solve this, and discuss why you think it would work.
